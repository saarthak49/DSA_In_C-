1. median in nxm array sorted rowwise
2. median of two sorted arrays
3. painter's partition problem
4. KMP Search Pattern
5. Manacher Algorithm - done but revise.
6. Target sum A[i]-A[j] == k
7. tortoise problem prove that they meet at the center. (see rough proved there)
8. Max area rectangle in histogram
9. stack that maintains the smallest element so far 
10. lazy propagatioon in segment tree
11. maintaining the maximum in each window of size k
12. inorder traversal of a binary tree using stack
13. morris traversal (threaded binary tree) for inorder traversal, think intuitively
14. josephus formula 2(n-2^(log n))+1
15. see how the traversals are implemented using stacks postorder and inorder become somewhat complex
16. minimum swaps to sort the array
17. see hashmap implementation in java
18. see elevator design pattern in OOPS lld
19. Dikstra's Algorithm
20. Prim's MST Algorithm   (Dikstra's and Prim's MST algorithms are more or less similar)
